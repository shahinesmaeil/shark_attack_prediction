# shark_attack_prediction
machine learning project on shark attacks 

Machine Learning Assignment, Summer 2022

Sydney City Council (SCC) is an Australian government agency responsible for the operation of one of the city’s beaches. There have been a number of recent shark
attacks at Australian beaches and SCC are keen to minimize risk to the public. They want to be able to predict whether a shark will appear at their beach. With this information, they will choose to close the beach or keep it open. While they do care about possible attacks, they also care about lost revenue to the local economy when the beach is closed. The data tells us if a shark appeared under certain conditions at a beach - under the column “shark”.

Your assignment is to use machine learning techniques to produce a system that would be able to tell SCC if a shark appearance is likely.

You can use Orange and Python on google colab. The             data for the assignment is in a file, shark.csv, provided for you. A data dictionary, datadictionary-shark.txt, is provided describing the columns in this file.
